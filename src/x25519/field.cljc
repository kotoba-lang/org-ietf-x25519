(ns x25519.field
  "Arithmetic in GF(2^255 - 19), the field Curve25519 is defined over.

  A field element is sixteen limbs of sixteen bits, held in a flat array —
  `long-array` on the JVM, `Float64Array` under ClojureScript. Both hold every
  intermediate this file produces exactly: a schoolbook product of two
  reduced elements reaches about 2^41, well inside a `long` and well inside
  the 2^53 where a JavaScript number is still an exact integer.

  ## Why limbs rather than a big integer

  The JVM has `BigInteger` and ClojureScript has `BigInt`, and they are not
  the same type with the same operations — a portable `.cljc` file cannot
  name one. Sixteen 16-bit limbs is the representation that needs neither: it
  is ordinary integer arithmetic on both, and it is the shape TweetNaCl chose
  for the same reason.

  ## What this file does NOT claim

  **It is not constant-time.** `car25519` and `pack25519` branch on the sign
  of an intermediate, and `sel25519` is a data-independent swap only in the
  sense that it always runs — the JIT on either runtime is free to
  specialise it. A timing side channel is a property of the machine code, and
  no portable Clojure can promise anything about that. `x25519.core` says the
  same thing where a caller will read it."
