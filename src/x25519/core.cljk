  "[RFC 7748](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7748) X25519 — the
  Diffie-Hellman function on Curve25519 — in portable `.cljc`, with no
  dependencies.

  Written because `manifest/dependency-substitution.edn` named it: HPKE
  (RFC 9180) is the workspace's last cryptographic gap that composes out of
  parts it already has — HKDF in `kotoba-lang/crypto`, ChaCha20-Poly1305 in
  `kotoba-lang/noise` — and DHKEM(X25519) was the one piece missing. Every
  mention of x25519 in this workspace was a call site; none was an
  implementation.

  ## Use

      (x25519 private-key their-public-key)  ; 32 bytes -> 32 bytes
      (public-key private-key)               ; X25519(k, 9)

  Bytes are `Sequential` collections of ints in 0..255, in and out.

  ## Two things to know

  **An all-zero output means a low-order point.** RFC 7748 §6.1: a peer can
  send a u-coordinate of small order, and the shared secret is then zero
  regardless of your private key. `x25519` returns those bytes, because the
  RFC says the check is optional and where it belongs depends on the
  protocol — but `contributory?` is here so a caller that needs the check can
  write it as one call rather than a comparison against a literal.

  **This is not constant-time.** The ladder swaps with an arithmetic mask and
  the field avoids branching on secret values where it reasonably can, but
  timing is a property of machine code and no portable Clojure can promise
  anything about what two JITs emit. On a host where a timing side channel is
  in scope, use the platform's X25519 and treat this as the reference it is
  checked against."

  Clearing the low three bits makes the scalar a multiple of the cofactor, so
